\Abstract{
The success of Bitcoin and its follow-ups have demonstrated the value of decentralized consensus system among anonymous participants not trusting each other.
On top of the consensus network there can be a public ledger or even a general state transition machine, 
such that all participants agree on the state of the ledger or the state machine.
Conceptually the state machine can be Turing-complete and hence essentially a ``world computer'' shared by all participants, whose results cannot be tampered by any single person or entity.
However, the processing power of the shared state machine is currently bottlenecked on the throughput of underlying consensus system.

{\name} implements a Turing-complete state machine on top of a high-throughput consensus network.
% , which is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second.
To achieve a throughput of thousands of transactions per second, {\name} guarantees consensus on the total order of blocks organized in a \tg.
In this way, all forked blocks contribute to the security and throughput of {\name} as well.
In this work we discuss {\name} protocol design and implementation specifications.

Since the born of Bitcoin, various blockchain projects have demonstrated extraordinary success with the power of consensus among permissionless and trustless parties.
The most successful blockchain project after Bitcoin is widely considered to be Ethereum, which generalizes the blockchain paradigm from a specialized value-transfer system to a more generalized Turing-complete state machine that allows conceptually all kinds of computation.
This generalized state machine, known as \emph{Ethereum Virtual Machine} (EVM), makes the Ethereum network essentially a decentralized computing platform 
where the state advances on input of transactions.
Sometimes Ethereum is referred to as the ``world computer'' that nobody can shut down, 
except that its processing power is rather poor and severely bounded by the throughput of underlying consensus.

The consensus throughput of Bitcoin is (in expectation) one block per $10$ minutes, with block size $1$MB (or $2$MB with Segregated Witness (segwit)).
Bitcoin is set to small block size and low generation rate mainly for security concerns.
Intuitively, when there is no adversary, the natural probability of forks is proportional to the ratio of  block broadcasting time to block (generation) time,
since under the longest chain rule honest mining power may keep working on a fork during the propagation of a newly mined block.
Ethereum applies a tailored version of GHOST rule \cite{GHOST} and smaller block size to achieve a much shorter block time, i.e. roughly $<100$KB per $15$ seconds.
Inclusive Block Chain Protocol \cite{Inclusive} is a ``block-DAG'' proposal which defines a total order of blocks in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) rather than a chain, with the major advantage over GHOST that all forked blocks contribute to the consensus throughput as well. 
Another line of scaling techniques trades security and decentralization for scalability by using sharding, sidechains, or other second layer extensions.
In extreme cases, centralized and somehow permissioned consensus systems are implemented in practice.


{\name} is a project which aims at building a high throughput first layer consensus system without any compromises in security and decentralization; a generalized computation platform that securely processes at least thousands of transactions per second which makes the  throughput of consensus is no more a bottleneck.
The positioning of {\name} is a strong backbone consensus network on which a numerous number of unprecedented applications and extensions can germinate and thrive.
Technically, we follow a similar idea as \cite{Inclusive} but organize blocks in a \tg, 
which enables a fast implementation of the {\name} protocol.

In \name we use $\kec$ as the collision-resistant hash function unless otherwise explicitly specified.

For authentication in the current version of \name, we use the same recoverable ECDSA signature scheme as in Ethereum \cite{ETH_yellow}. 
This method utilizes the \textsf{SECP-256k1} curve.
 % as described by Courtois et al. [2014], and is implemented similarly to as described by Gura et al. [2004] on p. 9 of 15, para. 3.

\section{Checklist for porting EVM contract to Conflux}

The Ethereum contract is also a valid Conflux contract. So Ethereum contracts can be ported to Conflux easily and have almost same execution results. But notice that Conflux may have different behavior in the following points:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Gas used and refund:} Conflux requires less gas in SSTORE operation but no longer refunds resetting storage and contract destruction. 
	\item {\bf Gas fee refund:} Conflux will refund at most 1/4 of gas limit. So try to provide an accurate estimation for gas limit before signing transactions. 
	\item {\bf Contract address:} Conflux uses a different way to compute address for normal account from public key and compute contract address in contract creation. (See equation~(\ref{eq:account-address}) and (\ref{eq:new-address}) for details.) The contract developers usually don't need to handle this difference. 
	\item {\bf Contract address conflict:} If the contract address has existed before contract creation, Conflux will abort the contract creation. This is different with the behavior in Ethereum. 
	\item {\bf Collateral for storage:} Conflux requires collateral for storage. Please make sure there is enough balance for storage collateral. 

\end{itemize}
