\section{Checklist for porting EVM contract to Conflux}

The Ethereum contract is also a valid Conflux contract. So Ethereum contracts can be ported to Conflux easily and have almost same execution results. But notice that Conflux may have different behavior in the following points:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Gas used and refund:} Conflux requires less gas in SSTORE operation but no longer refunds resetting storage and contract destruction. 
	\item {\bf Gas fee refund:} Conflux will refund at most 1/4 of gas limit. So try to provide an accurate estimation for gas limit before signing transactions. 
	\item {\bf Contract address:} Conflux uses a different way to compute address for normal account from public key and compute contract address in contract creation. (See equation~(\ref{eq:account-address}) and (\ref{eq:new-address}) for details.) The contract developers usually don't need to handle this difference. 
	\item {\bf Contract address conflict:} If the contract address has existed before contract creation, Conflux will abort the contract creation. This is different with the behavior in Ethereum. 
	\item {\bf Collateral for storage:} Conflux requires collateral for storage. Please make sure there is enough balance for storage collateral. 

\end{itemize}
